### Required libraries
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn

### Steps for running the code:

- download the training data (train.zip), the testing data (test.zip) and the solution (sample_solution.csv.zip, the gauge readings for the testing data) from the [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-much-did-it-rain-ii/data)
- unzip the above zip files in the same directory as the source code rain.py
- go to the source code directory 
- run the program by 'python ./rain.py'
